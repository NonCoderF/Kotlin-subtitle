1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,080
YEAH.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,840
i spit raps like a heart attack. fast fatal heart impact

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,680
Past painful scars in fact, I blast tasteful bars in packs

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,620
I back up my actions, fact, don't ask, grab reactions, jacked

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,380
Attack with every word then act with class, as they hear me snap

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,040
I got nothing to lose, 'cause I fought and felt the bruise

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,700
Now I'm not the one confused, call the shots and they produce

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,420
I ain't lost I'm finally loose, pick a noose over excuse

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,520
I need the views to boost me to a new abuse of being used

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,460
Everybody wants a piece now, y'all can rest in peace now

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,360
Your dead to me so peace out, remember your discrete doubt

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,280
Get ready for defeat now, I'm gon' make you bleed out

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,160
Listen on repeat now and weed out all the weak now

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,560
Get up and make a change, don't remember yesterday

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,340
If you got something to say, speak your mind before your grave

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,260
'cause your life is yours to save, ain't nobody gonna change

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,020
Everybody stays the same, so be different, make a name, huh?

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,540
And just like a soldier

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,040
I keep on moving forward

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,080
Always getting closer

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,040
I march until it's over

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,720
And just like a soldier

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,800
I keep on moving forward

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,440
Always getting closer

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
I march until it's over

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,280
And just like a soldier

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
I keep on moving forward

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,120
Always getting closer

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
I march until it's over

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,600
And just like a soldier

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
I keep on moving forward

32
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Always getting closer

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
I march until it's over

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,000
It's ridiculous, I'm spitting this meticulous and limitless

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,180
While others out there spitting shit, got hits up on the charts that sit

36
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,900
I see why other artists quit: 'cause people don't reward good shit

37
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,660
They love to hate but hate to live, society you swing and miss

38
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,920
And honestly, I get it, promise me you won't regret it

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,160
Wasting energy, forget it, don't look back, go on get it

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,900
Bite the bullet just a bit, bite your tongue and don't say shit

41
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,680
Make your actions hard to miss, be a legend not a myth

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,940
It's obnoxious that I'm conscious, rapping honest

43
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,620
As promised, try to harness, as an artist

44
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,480
Stay modest, it's a long quest, I will not quit

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,340
'til ten thousand people going off when I drop this

46
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,920
I gotta make it now, swear to god I'm breaking out

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,720
Swear to god I'll take a bow, center stage with a crowd

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,560
'cause I got it figured out, I'm just honest and I'm loud

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,600
Staying modest but I'm proud, no, I never had doubt, yea

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
And just like a soldier

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
I keep on moving forward

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,560
Always getting closer

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,440
march until it's over

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,080
And just like a soldier

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,120
I keep on moving forward

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,840
Always getting closer

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
I march until it's over

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
And just like a soldier

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
I keep on moving forward

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Always getting closer

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
I march until it's over

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,160
And just like a soldier

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
I keep on moving forward

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
Always getting closer

65
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
I march until it's over

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
And just like a soldier

67
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
I keep on moving forward

68
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Always getting closer

69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
I march until it's over

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
And just like a soldier

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I keep on moving forward

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Always getting closer

73
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
I march until it's over
